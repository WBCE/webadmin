# webadmin
Webadmin as an WBCE admin tool. Attention! This is really a dangerous tool with complete access to all files on the server. Since it looks (and behaves) like a backdoor/shell (you can create, edit and upload all kinds of files with it), some webhosters prevent uploading it. Use it only if you really do not have any other option and unistall it immediately after use.
